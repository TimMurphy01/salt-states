## Description:

Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programming.  It has many features to process text files and to do system management tasks (as in perl).  It is simple, straight-forward, and extensible.

This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default Ruby version (currently v1.9.3).
