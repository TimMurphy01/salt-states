# logrotate

## Description:

The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of log files on a system which generates a lot of log files.  Logrotate allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of log files.  Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly, monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size.  Normally, logrotate runs as a daily cron job.
