# make

## Description:

GNU Make is an utility which controls the generation of executables and other target files of a program from the program's source files. It determines automatically which pieces of a large program need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create them. Make is not limited to programs and executable, it can be applied to any task where a set of target files must be created based on a set of input files, based on dependency and processing rules. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency solver.
