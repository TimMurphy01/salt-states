# juju

## Description:

Through the use of charms, juju provides you with shareable, re-usable, and repeatable expressions of devops best practices. You can use them unmodified, or easily change and connect them to fit your needs. Deploying a charm is similar to installing a package on Ubuntu: ask for it and it??s there, remove it and it??s completely gone.

This is a dependency package providing the current version of Juju.
