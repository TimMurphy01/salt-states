# ruby-ffi-rzmq

## Description:

?MQ is a library which extends the standard socket interfaces with features traditionally provided by specialised messaging middleware products.

?MQ sockets provide an abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging patterns, message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple transport protocols and more.

This module wraps ?MQ using Ruby FFI (foreign function interface). It is a pure Ruby wrapper so it can be used with any Ruby runtime that supports FFI, including MRI, Rubinius and JRuby.
