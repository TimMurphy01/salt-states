Testrepository provides a database of test results and supports easy workflows to be built on top of that database. For instance, running just failing tests or getting the last test run back to examine again (without running the tests again). Testrepository is compatible with any test suite that can output subunit. This includes any TAP test suite and any pyunit compatible test suite.

The testrepository package contains the CLI front end.
