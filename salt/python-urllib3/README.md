# python-urllib3

## Description:

urllib3 supports features left out of urllib and urllib2 libraries.

 - Re-use the same socket connection for multiple requests (HTTPConnectionPool
   and HTTPSConnectionPool) (with optional client-side certificate
   verification).
 - File posting (encode_multipart_formdata).
 - Built-in redirection and retries (optional).
 - Supports gzip and deflate decoding.
 - Thread-safe and sanity-safe.
 - Small and easy to understand codebase perfect for extending and
   building upon.
