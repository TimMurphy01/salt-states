# gradle

## Description:

Gradle is a build system written in Groovy. It uses Groovy also as the language for its build scripts. It has a powerful multi-project build support. It has a layer on top of Ivy that provides a build-by-convention integration for Ivy. It gives you always the choice between the flexibility of Ant and the convenience of a build-by-convention behavior.
