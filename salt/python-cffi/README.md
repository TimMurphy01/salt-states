## Description:

Convenient and reliable way of calling C code from Python.

The aim of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable way of calling C code from Python. It keeps Python logic in Python, and minimises the C required. It is able to work at either the C API or ABI level, unlike most other approaches, that only support the ABI level.
