# python-docutils

## Description:

reStructuredText is an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntax and parser system. It is useful for in-line program documentation (such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents.

The purpose of the Docutils project is to create a set of tools for processing reStructuredText documentation into useful formats, such as HTML, LaTeX, ODT or Unix manpages.

This package includes Python 2 modules and command line utilities.
