# euca2ools

## Description:

Command-line tools for interacting with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other AWS-compatible services, such as Eucalyptus and OpenStack, that export a REST/Query-based API compatible with Amazon EC2, IAM, and S3 services.  The tools can be used with both Amazon's services and with installations of the Eucalyptus open-source cloud-computing infrastructure.  The tools were inspired by command-line tools distributed by Amazon (api-tools and ami-tools) and largely accept the same options and environment variables.  However, these tools were implemented from scratch in Python.
